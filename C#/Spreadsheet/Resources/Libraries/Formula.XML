            <para>Represents formulas written in standard infix notation using standard precedence
            rules.  The allowed symbols are non-negative numbers written using double-precision 
            floating-point syntax; variables that consist of a letter or underscore followed by 
            zero or more letters, underscores, or digits; parentheses; and the four operator 
            symbols +, -, *, and /. </para> 
            
            <para>Spaces are significant only insofar that they delimit tokens.  For example, "xy" is
            a single variable, "x y" consists of two variables "x" and y; "x23" is a single variable; 
            and "x 23" consists of a variable "x" and a number "23".</para>
            
            <para>Associated with every formula are two delegates:  a normalizer and a validator.  The
            normalizer is used to convert variables into a canonical form, and the validator is used
            to add extra restrictions on the validity of a variable (beyond the standard requirement 
            that it consist of a letter or underscore followed by zero or more letters, underscores,
            or digits.)  Their use is described in detail in the constructor and method comments.</para>
