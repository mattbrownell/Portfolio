Create an account or log in with an existing one after launching the app.

Once on the level select screen start by selecting level 1 and get familiar with the layout of the GUI. The game currently has five commands you can slot into the sequence:
-Forward to move Codey forward a single square.
-Jump to jump two squares ahead.
-Wait to wait a turn.
-If will play whatever it is that you have set inside your if brackets.
-For will play the for commands an amount of times determined by the spinbox.

Levels will be scored based on frugal use of the if and loop, if they are not used you will result in lower scores to be seen by the teachers on the web application.
